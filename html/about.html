            <h2>Welcome to my website.</h2>
            <p>My name is Jordan. I have been learning Web Development for the past 2 years. Started out learning with online tutorials from various websites. After about two months I decided to research leaning more but at a college. Originally I started out at Bryan University of Arizonia learning Full Stack Web Development but after a thirteen months I decided to make a move to a different school that was a better fit for me. Full Sail University of Florida is where I ended up, to finish learning for my Associates Degree.</p>
            <p>Studying at two different schools gave me extra insight into many aspects of web development. The positive effects were I got to see more and learn more compared to if I only went to one college. My goal is to some day have a job in the web development field until then I will keep learning and adding more skills to my knowledge base. One day I will be as comfortable in web development as I am in carpentry.</p>

            <h3>Free Time</h3>
            <p>In my free time I like to learn or practice new technique's. Sometimes I will go online on random websites and see how they work or the design of them, often I even compare websites, weather it's personal or commercial. I'm a hands on person that is mechanically inclined. If it's anything to do with automotive or carpentry/ housing electrical I can do it!</p>

            <h3>Other</h3>
            <p>I'm a carpenter by trade. I grew up learning it and haven't stopped. Most jobs were either sales or carpentry. I been doing carpentry my whole life so I always tend to resort back to it. I worked in sales for about 8 years as a car sales consultant at Empire Hyundai.</p>
